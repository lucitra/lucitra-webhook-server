ðŸ“‹ Next steps:
1. Go to https://github.com/lucitra/lucitra-webhook-server/settings/branches
2. Add branch protection rules:

   For 'main' branch:
   - Require pull request reviews (2 approvals)
   - Require status checks to pass (staging deployment)
   - Require branches to be up to date
   - Include administrators
   
   For 'staging' branch:
   - Require pull request reviews (1 approval)
   - Require status checks to pass (terraform-check, local-test)
   - Require branches to be up to date
   
   For 'develop' branch:
   - Require status checks to pass (terraform-check, local-test)

3. Set up GitHub environments:
   - development (auto-deploy from develop)
   - staging (auto-deploy from staging)
   - production (requires approval, deploys from main)
